  This is a set of data and routines that test out various aspects of 
the parametric regression models.  If you have any questions about
the models, start by looking at these examples.

  If you want to rerun the test suite, for validity purposes:
     First, look at the file "setup.s", and change it as appropriate so that
the new survival routines are accessed.  
     Do "sh testall.sh" to run the full suite of tests, a file "testall.out"
will be created.
     Compare testall.out to testall.save
     Compare testall.ps to testsave.ps, (by printing them, not by characters)

  The test takes a while to run.  In particular, the "donnell2" file
does a large number of fits before drawing a contour map.
