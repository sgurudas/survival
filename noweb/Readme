 Some portions of the survival package have been written using the literate
programming paradym.  These are contained here, and have a .Rnw suffix.
Long term, the plan is to have all of the code source here to maximize
the documentation, and through it the reliability of the package. 

These files are NOT intended for processing by Sweave.  The function of Sweave
is to execute R fragments, interspersing code and results.  The purpose of
this material is to create the .R source code and a detailed latex commentary
on that code.  In particular, Sweave cannot reassemble a named chunk of
code from scattered fragments.  The latter is one of the main advantages
of the noweb system: you can organise the presentation for optimal explanation
rather than in exectuion order.

The functions found in noweb.R are an R implementation of the notangle
command, and allow this code to auto-compile on CRAN, for those without
a noweb installation.  The .Rnw source to this is kept in the coxme package,
look there for further information and comments.

The result file all.pdf is documentation for understanding the code, 
not how to use the survival functions for data analysis.  For those who
maintain the code it will be a big help, for everyone else I'd expect
it to be boring.

Note: The Makefile must be processed with ``R CMD make''.
